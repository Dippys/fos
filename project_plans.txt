Project Plans
------------------
Overview:
This is a 2D multiplayer online game built using Phaser for the client-side and Colyseus for the server-side. The game world consists of different scenes (rooms), and players can move between them while maintaining their avatar state.

Current Features:
- **Client-Side (Phaser):**
  - Multiple game scenes (e.g., Beach, Castle, Downtown, School, etc.).
  - Player movement and animations.
  - Room transition system.
  - UI management.
  - Basic inventory system.
  - Network communication through WebSockets.

- **Server-Side (Colyseus):**
  - Game rooms are managed via `GameRoom.ts`.
  - Player state management (`PlayerState.ts`).
  - Room state management (`RoomState.ts`).

Next Steps:
1. Implement a **unique player name system** that prompts users if their chosen name is already in use.
2. Optimize **network efficiency** by ensuring only relevant player data is transmitted to clients.
3. Address the **WebSocket ‘already in CLOSING or CLOSED state’ error**, if necessary.
4. Improve **inventory system functionality** and potentially expand it.
5. Refine and balance **animations and UI elements**.
